An article in last weekends **â€˜Observerâ€™**, summed up the current state of the UK jobs market.

> #### â€˜It's not quite the Black Death, but worker shortages hit UK firms hard.'

> #### â€˜Soaring vacancy rates mean employers need to work hard to attract and retain staff - this will require a shift in attitude to succeed.â€™

> #### â€˜Vacancies are increasing across all industry sectors â€“ including professional services.â€™

> #### â€˜The â€˜Great Resignationâ€™ hits the UKâ€™.

> #### â€˜This isnâ€™t about pay â€“ â€˜meddling with pay wonâ€™t help.â€™

> #### â€˜Todayâ€™s experts say a different approach is needed â€“ given changing views about work â€“ and how people want to be led.â€™

In their book **Out of Office,** published in January 2022, **Charles Warzel** and **Helen Anne Peterson** identify four critical themes companies will have to work on to attract and retain employees:

* **Flexibility** â€“ people are looking for flexibility in where they work and how they work
* **Community and Teamwork** â€“ being part of something bigger
* **Personal Development** â€“ including keeping up to date with technology and how technology impacts business (not just as a productivity tool)
* **Fun** - Work that is interesting and fun.

In the session on Friday, 11th February, **Paul Graham** discussed how different elements of **Microsoft 365** and **Teams** can be used to facilitate all four of the themes:
